The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is a new open source transport planning tool

The PCT provides an evidence base for prioritising cycling infrastructure

Cycling 'desire lines' are modelled and allocated to the network in English cities

Future scenarios such as 'Go Dutch' show shifting pattern of cycling uptake

The PCT can be readily deployed in new settings, at city to national scales
