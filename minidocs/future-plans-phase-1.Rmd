# Additional features

Two important additions to the tool from
the perspective of transport planners were reported during user testing
to be the addition of model
output (to exactly what underlies the model) and the display of the overall
propensity of cycling along 'desire lines' and allocated to the road network.

It is proposed that the former is implemented as a new 'tab' at the top of the
tool, between the 'Interactive map' and 'Help' tabs.

Currently we display 'point to point flows' with no option to view the whole
route network. The 'route network' would show a simplified version of the whole
route network with an indication of the segments of highest SLC and SIC displayed.
We could add the option to change from 'point to point' to 'route network' in
'Advanced Options' or have the network as default (and the option to change to
'point to point'). We have a preference for adding the route network to the
map with an 'advance settings' or 'network analysis' button in the map tab,
rather than in a new tab for the sake of simplicity.

# Server options

There are a range of options for serving the NPCT for Phase 2. We recommend, for
flexibility, scalability and easy of deployment in other countries the use of
Google Cloud. Set-up by our in-house developer, we budget Â£10,000 per year for
server deployment and support for the duration of the project. This would
greatly increase the stability and scalability of the web tool, allowing it to
handle hundreds of requests simultaneously.

# Nationwide deployment

To deploy the tool nationwide, we recommend a single site (in addition to
the current set-up which operates on a per-local authority basis). This would
begin with a map of England. When the user zooms in beyond a certain point,
the software will detect which administrative zone to use for the data.
That will allow deployment to a single url.

There is a debate about whether Local Authorities (Unitary and Country, CUAs),
Combined Authorities (CAs) or Local Economic Partnerships (LEPs) are
the appropriate level of analysis. It seems transport planners favour the latter
the level that they work in, that most still operate at the LEP level although
there is a trend towards work at LEP and CA levels.
We could potentially deploy LA and LEP versions of the tool nationwide.
We suggest deploying at the LA level first, reserving
url-specific versions for the tool for specific CAs and LEPs that request the tool,
e.g. Transport for Greater Manchester.

# Inclusion of micro-level results 

Results arising from the micro-level model will require a new 'tab'
and a new map design to display the results. This could be an 'optional extra'
or a default tab, depending on when there is high demand for micro-level
results. This will partly depend on future user testing.
