abstract = {Modifying transport infrastructure to support active travel (walking and cycling) could help to increase population levels of physical activity. However, there is limited evidence for the effects of interventions in this field, and to the best of our knowledge no study has convincingly demonstrated an increase in physical activity directly attributable to this type of intervention. We have therefore taken the opportunity presented by a 'natural experiment' in Cambridgeshire, UK to establish a quasi-experimental study of the effects of a major transport infrastructural intervention on travel behaviour, physical activity and related wider health impacts.},

@article{Aultman-Hall1997a,
abstract = {A geographic information system (GIS) network data base is used to determine the characteristics of 397 routes used by commuter cyclists in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, and to compare them with the shortest- path routes between each origin and destination. The analysis of route data provides useful insight for understanding factors affecting travel behavior and in this case provides quantitative support for many exist- ing assumptions regarding commuter cyclist behavior. Most com- muters divert very little from their minimum path (0.4 km on average) and are found to use major road routes. The cyclists tend to avoid grades, grade-separated railway crossings, and high-activity areas, but not road (as opposed to pedestrian) bridges. Cyclists use traffic signals especially for crossing major roadways and turning. The high-quality direct off-road paths are used only infrequently by the commuter cyclists and the lower quality ones even less. The results of this analy- sis suggest that efforts to accommodate current commuter cyclists should be focused on improving cycling conditions on the road net- work, such as providing wider curb lanes, or actuated traffic signal detectors that recognize the presence of bicycles. If potential new com- muters are similar to the minority of current commuter cyclists in this study who use mainly local roads, paths or trails, then projects that make the network of local roads and pathways more connective and direct may encourage a higher level of commuter cycling.},

abstract = {In just under seven years, Twitter has grown to count nearly 3\% of the entire global population among its active users who have sent more than 170 billion 140-character messages. Today the service plays such a significant role in American culture that the Library of Congress has assembled a permanent archive of the site back to its first tweet, updated daily. With its open API, Twitter has become one of the most popular data sources for social research, yet the majority of the literature has focused on it as a text or network graph source, with only limited efforts to date focusing exclusively on the geography of Twitter, assessing the various sources of geographic information on the service and their accuracy. More than 3\% of all tweets are found to have native location information available, while a naive geocoder based on a simple major cities gazetteer and relying on the user-provided Location and Profile fields is able to geolocate more than a third of all tweets with high accuracy when measured against the GPS-based baseline. Geographic proximity is found to play a minimal role both in who users communicate with and what they communicate about, providing evidence that social media is shifting the communicative landscape.},

These trips would mostly otherwise have been made on foot (31\%) or by public transport (47\%). To date there has been a trend towards fewer fatalities and injuries than expected on cycle hire bicycles. Using these observed injury rates, the population benefits from the cycle hire scheme substantially outweighed harms (net change -72 DALYs (95\% credible interval -110 to -43) among men using cycle hire per accounting year; -15 (-42 to -6) among women; note that negative DALYs represent a health benefit). When we modelled cycle hire injury rates as being equal to background rates for all cycling in central London, these benefits were smaller and there was no evidence of a benefit among women (change -49 DALYs (-88 to -17) among men; -1 DALY (-27 to 12) among women). This sex difference largely reflected higher road collision fatality rates for female cyclists. At older ages the modelled benefits of cycling were much larger than the harms. Using background injury rates in the youngest age group (15 to 29 years), the medium term benefits and harms were both comparatively small and potentially negative.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: London's bicycle sharing system has positive health impacts overall, but these benefits are clearer for men than for women and for older users than for younger users. The potential benefits of cycling may not currently apply to all groups in all settings.},

@article{Lewis2006,
abstract = {Global energy consumption is projected to increase, even in the face of substantial declines in energy intensity, at least 2-fold by midcentury relative to the present because of population and economic growth. This demand could be met, in principle, from fossil energy resources, particularly coal. However, the cumulative nature of CO(2) emissions in the atmosphere demands that holding atmospheric CO(2) levels to even twice their preanthropogenic values by midcentury will require invention, development, and deployment of schemes for carbon-neutral energy production on a scale commensurate with, or larger than, the entire present-day energy supply from all sources combined. Among renewable energy resources, solar energy is by far the largest exploitable resource, providing more energy in 1 hour to the earth than all of the energy consumed by humans in an entire year. In view of the intermittency of insolation, if solar energy is to be a major primary energy source, it must be stored and dispatched on demand to the end user. An especially attractive approach is to store solar-converted energy in the form of chemical bonds, i.e., in a photosynthetic process at a year-round average efficiency significantly higher than current plants or algae, to reduce land-area requirements. Scientific challenges involved with this process include schemes to capture and convert solar energy and then store the energy in the form of chemical bonds, producing oxygen from water and a reduced fuel such as hydrogen, methane, methanol, or other hydrocarbon species.},

abstract = {Twitter is a free social networking and micro-blogging service that enables its millions of users to send and read each other's "tweets," or short, 140-character messages. The service has more than 190 million registered users and processes about 55 million tweets per day. Useful information about news and geopolitical events lies embedded in the Twitter stream, which embodies, in the aggregate, Twitter users' perspectives and reactions to current events. By virtue of sheer volume, content embedded in the Twitter stream may be useful for tracking or even forecasting behavior if it can be extracted in an efficient manner. In this study, we examine the use of information embedded in the Twitter stream to (1) track rapidly-evolving public sentiment with respect to H1N1 or swine flu, and (2) track and measure actual disease activity. We also show that Twitter can be used as a measure of public interest or concern about health-related events. Our results show that estimates of influenza-like illness derived from Twitter chatter accurately track reported disease levels.},

To do this, we have sampled Twitter messages from the February 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand.We annotated locations in messages manually to make a gold standard by which to measure locations identified by a Named Entity Recognition software. The Stanford NER software found some locations that were proper nouns, but did not identify locations that were not capitalized, local streets and buildings, or non- standard place abbreviations and mis-spellings that are plentiful in microtext. We review how these problems might be solved in software research, and model a readable crisis map that shows crisis location clusters via enlarged place labels.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to model China's province-to-province migration flows using spatial interaction models. To date, conventional, gravity-type, spatial interaction models have typically employed information only on the number of movers and on the distances between places. This paper employs a new, multivariate approach to such interaction modeling by entering additional variables into the traditional modeling framework. In this particular application, two variables are added, namely, a measure of past migration, called migrant stock, and another measure of annual average total investment. The empirical verification of the models employs two interprovincial migration data sets for China. These involve the 1982-87 and 1985-90 migration flow data, consisting of two 28 × 28 data matrices. The results of the calibration show that the models with the additional variable(s) are capable of distributing migration flows with a much-improved degree of accuracy, in comparison with the conventional model. The calibration therefore provides empirical support for the validity of the multivariate approach to the spatial interaction modeling of migration flows.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surveys are popular methods to measure public perceptions in emergencies but can be costly and time consuming. We suggest and evaluate a complementary "infoveillance" approach using Twitter during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Our study aimed to: 1) monitor the use of the terms "H1N1" versus "swine flu" over time; 2) conduct a content analysis of "tweets"; and 3) validate Twitter as a real-time content, sentiment, and public attention trend-tracking tool.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Between May 1 and December 31, 2009, we archived over 2 million Twitter posts containing keywords "swine flu," "swineflu," and/or "H1N1." using Infovigil, an infoveillance system. Tweets using "H1N1" increased from 8.8\% to 40.5\% (R(2) = .788; p<.001), indicating a gradual adoption of World Health Organization-recommended terminology. 5,395 tweets were randomly selected from 9 days, 4 weeks apart and coded using a tri-axial coding scheme. To track tweet content and to test the feasibility of automated coding, we created database queries for keywords and correlated these results with manual coding. Content analysis indicated resource-related posts were most commonly shared (52.6\%). 4.5\% of cases were identified as misinformation. News websites were the most popular sources (23.2\%), while government and health agencies were linked only 1.5\% of the time. 7/10 automated queries correlated with manual coding. Several Twitter activity peaks coincided with major news stories. Our results correlated well with H1N1 incidence data.

CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the potential of using social media to conduct "infodemiology" studies for public health. 2009 H1N1-related tweets were primarily used to disseminate information from credible sources, but were also a source of opinions and experiences. Tweets can be used for real-time content analysis and knowledge translation research, allowing health authorities to respond to public concerns.},

abstract = {We present a "Bicycle Highway" transportation alternative to automobile
commuting by exploring avenues for reducing perceived impediments
to bicycle commuting. The three primary goals of the project are:
1) Address the American diabetes and obesity epidemics by making
exercising on a daily basis a more desirable and viable alternative.
2) Address the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants
by partially replacing combustion engines with human-powered transportation.
3) Address the problem of the United States' dependence on foreign
oil by diminishing energy demand for short-range transportation.
The primary variables we will consider are N, the number of people
being transported, d, the distance being traveled, C, the energy
cost required to travel the distance, and t, the time required to
travel the distance. The Bicycle Highway was found to have a poorer
throughput rating when only construction costs were considered, but
a better throughput rating when vehicle and fuel costs are introduced.
The Bicycle Highway offers a timely and economical solution to the
numerous side-effects of the century-long success of the gasoline-powered
automobile. A transportation corridor that is designated solely for
bicyclists, human-electric hybrid and zero-emission vehicles, would
allow for a greater volume of commuter traffic with minimal energetic
and entropic impact. This proposed roadway promises to make bicycle
travel much safer and will alleviate frustration felt by motorists
sharing the road with bicycles. We expect cost-effectiveness of our
design to be enhanced further if reductions in obesity, asthma, and
lung-disease related costs are considered in future case studies.},

abstract = {We measured the metabolic cost (C) and mechanical work of riding historic bicycles at different speeds: these bicycles included the Hobby Horse (1820s), the Boneshaker (1860s), the High Wheeler (1870s), the Rover (1880s), the Safety (1890s) and a modern bicycle (1980s) as a mean of comparison. The rolling resistance and air resistance of each vehicle were assessed. The mechanical internal work (W(INT)) was measured from three-dimensional motion analysis of the Hobby Horse and modern bicycle moving on a treadmill at different speeds. The equation obtained from the modern bicycle data was applied to the other vehicles. We found the following results. (i) Apart from the Rover, which was introduced for safety reasons, every newly invented bicycle improved metabolic economy. (ii) The rolling resistance decreased with subsequent designs while the frontal area and, hence, aerodynamic drag was fairly constant (except for the High Wheeler). (iii) The saddle-assisted body weight relief (which was inaugurated by the Hobby Horse) was responsible for most of the reduction in metabolic cost compared with walking or running. Further reductions in C were due to decreases in stride/pedalling frequency and, hence, W(INT) at the same speeds. (iv) The introduction of gear ratios allowed the use of pedalling frequencies that optimize the power/contraction velocity properties of the propulsive muscles. As a consequence, net mechanical efficiency (the ratio between the total mechanical work and C) was almost constant (0.273 +/- 0.015s.d.) for all bicycle designs, despite the increase in cruising speed. In the period from 1820 to 1890, improved design of bicycles increased the metabolically equivalent speed by threefold compared with walking at an average pace of ca. + 0.5 ms(-1) per decade [corrected]. The speed gain was the result of concurrent technological advancements in wheeled, human-powered vehicles and of 'smart' adaptation of the same actuator (the muscle) to different operational conditions.},

A greater understanding of the urban transport system and the improvements needed to create a safer cycling environment are essential if cyclists are to be safe and increased cycling participation targets are to be achieved. The proposed study will use existing cyclist crash data along with unique cyclist exposure data to develop road infrastructure prototypes that improve cyclists’ safety and evaluate the effectiveness of these prototypes in a cycling simulator.Methods and design This study will be conducted in two Australian cities namely Perth and Melbourne as both cities have policies that strongly advocate cycling. Two methods of data collection will be employed: (1) in-depth crash investigations of injured cyclists; and (2) video footage of cyclist exposure through a naturalistic cycling study of non-injured cyclists. The findings from these two methods will be used to develop new urban road design prototypes which will be tested with a sample of cyclists and motorists in safe environment namely, a cycling simulator and a driving simulator.Discussion By designing and evaluating safer environments for cyclists, this study will identify solutions that reduce the risk of road trauma and importantly, support this alternative mode of transport and thereby contribute to a reduction in traffic-related emissions and pollution and enhance sustainable economic and social connectivity.},

The application of a methodology for generating synthetic microdata from a number of different aggregate sources is reported. The resultant information system can be used in a flexible manner to product distributions not currently available from aggregate sources. Additionally, the microdata form direct inputs into microsimulation models.

In this paper, we report on research using data which provides some valuable information about migration behaviour in connection with other demographic and lifestyle characteristics obtained from several large geo-referenced cross-sectional annual sample surveys of the British population originating from the commercial sector. In particular, the paper uses a method of sample weighting to compensate for potential biases related to unequal probabilities of selection. The findings suggest, however, that the unweighted commercial microdata can be used in migration modelling to give reassuringly reliable estimates of associational patterns of key demographic, socio-economic and behavioural/lifestyle characteristics.},

abstract = {This research, which was conducted from July 2008 to January 2010, investigated what type of cycling infrastructure would encourage ‘new cyclists’ (ie people who either do not currently cycle at all, or people who do not currently cycle for utilitarian trips) to use cycling as their mode of transport for daily activities in New Zealand. The research involved undertaking an international literature review followed by national surveys and Christchurch-based focus groups, to gain an understanding of some of the motivations and barriers associated with utilitarian cycling, and to evaluate a range of cycling facilities. The research showed that safety was the most significant issue for potential cyclists, particularly in relation to vehicle driver behaviour and traffic volume. Other significant issues included having facilities at the destination for showering and changing, enjoyment, and the perception that car drivers are not courteous. The solutions that were most likely to effect a significant change in cycle numbers related to the nature and consistency of infrastructure, and education for motor vehicle drivers and cyclists on how to best and safely use it. The researchers recommended that along with a number of other cycling-supportive steps, planners could develop a comprehensive, consistent network of cycle-only paths with separation from motor vehicles, and with dedicated intersection facilities such as hook turns and cycle signals.},

abstract = {An ordered-response model is used in this research to evaluate the factors that affect frequency of bicycle use for a person's commute to and from work. Data used were gathered during an original survey effort conducted over the Internet in 2002. Empirical results are presented, and policy implications of these results for urban planning are discussed. In addition, deterrents and facilitators of bicycle commuting as reported by respondents in the survey are descriptively analyzed. Several findings from this research contribute to the state of the knowledge in bicycle commuting. First, the availability of showers or clothing lockers at the work place does not appear to inspire bicycle commuters to commute by bicycle more frequently. Second, using a bicycle for nonwork trip purposes increases an individual's frequency of commuting by bicycle to work. Other important results indicate that nonbicycle commuters either have misconceptions about the dangers of bicycling or else they lack convenient, safe route options for bicycling to work. Practitioners can use the ordered-response model to estimate an individual bicycle commuter's frequency of commuting by bicycle. The results can also help practitioners estimate the effects on nonmotorized mode share of programs that compete for funds to provide bicycling safety education, bicycle parking, and promotion of bicycling.},

@book{Odum1996,
abstract = {In this important new work, Howard T. Odum, widely acknowledged as the father of systems ecology, lucidly explains his concept of emergy, a measure of real wealth that provides a rational, science-based method of evaluating commodities, services, and environmental goods. Using specific real-world examples, Dr. Odum clearly demonstrates the revolutionary role of emergy in environmental management and policy making. Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making offers environmental professionals--policymakers, managers, ecologists, planners, developers, and activists--a systematic approach to environmental and economic valuation that will eliminate much of the rancor and adversarial decision making that often plagues environmental issues. Specifically, this book:  * Describes the theoretical basis, calculation procedures, and applications of emergy  * Introduces the concept of "transformity," the ratio of emergy (work put into a product) and energy (value received from the product)  * Provides formulas for emergy calculations, procedures for making an emergy evaluation table, and parameters for updating evaluations  * Demonstrates the use of emergy to evaluate environments, minerals, waters, primary energy sources, economic developments, and international trade  * Compares the emergy approach to environmental evaluation with others Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making will help environmental decision makers and the society they serve maximize economic vitality with less trial and error, innovate with fewer failures, and adapt to change more rapidly. It provides the tools they need to arrive at the best policies in resource management, economics, and the environment. Balancing the economy and the environment-- from the father of systems ecology Increasing economic dependence on diminishing natural resources has sparked a highly charged debate over the use and fate of the world environment. Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making presents a unique method of environmental management based on maximizing real wealth, the whole economy, and the public benefit. Renowned ecologist Howard T. Odum introduces the concept of emergy to provide a rational alternative to the tug-of-war over the world's most vital assets. Emergy measures the energy put into making a product and is the cornerstone of Odum's revolutionary text. This timely and important book offers key insights into:  * Determining the real value of a product or service  * Transformity, or the relationship between emergy (input) and energy (output)  * Stored wealth, available energy, and the final product  * Balancing economic and environmental needs Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making will help economists, ecologists, policymakers, and planners make more responsible, informed decisions to sustain economic and environmental development.},

Such discourse promotes notions of the flexible use of time and space, of people's decoupling from place and even of the end of geography — the belief that distance does not matter. Yet, in this article we argue that the roles of geographical stationarity and proximity in everyday life — understood as the creation and maintaining of pockets of local order — indicate the continuing and often neglected importance of the friction of distance. We demonstrate this empirically by focusing on the home as a pocket of local order, investigating the intensity and spatial extension of people's everyday activities, projects and contacts — their corporeal, virtual and medial (media-related) mobilities — with the world outside. We support our thesis with data from the population, household and individual levels.},

abstract = {A bicycle is a promising human-powered and emission-free transportation mode to address growing transportation and environmental problems. Bike-friendly environments should be constructed to innovatively increase the use of bicycles as a significant transportation mode. From this perspective, the scientific and effective monitoring of bicycling environments is of keen interest. An important technical challenge for monitoring is to evaluate the performance of bicycling environments. This study proposes a novel monitoring method that can be used for evaluating bicycle performance in terms of safety and mobility. An instrumented probe bicycle (IPB), which is equipped with a set of sensors including a global positioning systems (GPS) receiver, accelerometer, and gyro sensor, was used to develop the proposed monitoring method. The IPB provides useful bicycle maneuvering data for identifying longitudinal, lateral, and vertical maneuverings of the bicycle, which are affected by environmental factors such as heavy vehicle volume, surface conditions, grade, crossings, humps, and curbs. Regarding safety monitoring, an index to predict bicyclist's perceived safety and comfort with the predictors derived from the measurements by the IPB was developed. A questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain actual responses from bicyclists for perceived safety and comfort during the field experiment. In addition, a method to evaluate the bicycle mobility using GPS speed data was devised. Then, a fault tree analysis (FTA) technique, which is a well-known technique for risk analysis, was adopted to integrate safety and mobility monitoring. As a result, the bicycling monitoring index (BMI) was proposed. Data derived from the proposed method is expected to be effectively used for promoting the bicycle use by supporting the development and evaluation of various bicycle-related policies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The aim of this article is to explore the main issues involved with operationalizing entropy-maximizing models in a retail business context. We draw on our experiences of work undertaken with a variety of international blue-chip clients. First, we examine issues relating to demand estimation, focusing on practical considerations involved in different types of application. These issues include choice of demand estimation methodology, dealing with nonresidential flows and demand elasticity. Second, we investigate the supply-side or attractiveness component in detail, including a review of how such factors as brand preference, brand loyalty, and the so-called network effect can be addressed within a spatial interaction modeling framework. We then explore the distance decay variable in more detail before examining more specific measures of model performance. Historically in the literature, goodness of fit has been used as a measure of model performance, but we shall argue that goodness of forecast is the metric by which model performance should be measured. The difficulties of trying to achieve this are outlined and some examples discussed. El objetivo de este art\'{\i}culo es explorar la problem\'{a}tica de la puesta en pr\'{a}ctica de modelos de maximizaci\'{o}n de entrop\'{\i}a en el contexto de los negocios de ventas al consumidor (retail). Los autores utilizan su experiencia de trabajo con varios clientes de primer orden (blue-chip clients). Primero, se examina la problem\'{a}tica de la estimaci\'{o}n de la demanda, centr\'{a}ndose en las consideraciones pr\'{a}cticas de diferentes tipos de aplicaciones. Esta problem\'{a}tica incluye la selecci\'{o}n de una metodolog\'{\i}a para la estimaci\'{o}n de la demanda, el problema de flujos no-residenciales, y la elasticidad de la demanda. Segundo, se investiga en detalle el componente de oferta o atractividad, lo que incluye un examen de la forma en que factores como la preferencia y lealtad de marca, y el efecto de red (network effect) pueden ser abordados dentro del marco del modelado de interacci\'{o}n espacial. Luego se investiga el efecto de disminuci\'{o}n por distancia (distance decay) en m\'{a}s detalle para luego examinar medidas m\'{a}s espec\'{\i}ficas de performance de modelo. En la literatura especializada, la bondad de ajuste (goodness of fit) ha sido utilizada como medida de performance de modelos m\'{a}s com\'{u}n, pero los autores sostienen que la bondad de predicci\'{o}n (goodness of forecast) es una m\'{e}trica m\'{a}s apropiada. Finalmente, se presentan las dificultades existentes para alcanzar dicho tipos de medidas y se proporcionan algunos ejemplos.},

@article{Singleton2014a,
abstract = {Concerns have been raised in numerous countries over declining rates of active transport to school. In a UK context, the pupil-school commute is estimated to contribute around 658 kilotonnes of CO2 per year; however, tackling this issue effectively requires an improved understanding of how emissions can be modelled and mapped over a variety of scales. This paper implements a new estimation technique for the modelling of CO2 emissions linked with the school commute that integrates both transport network-level routing and geographically disaggregate vehicle emissions data. The model is then applied to a national cohort of pupils in England. Areas demonstrating the highest emissions were typically more rural and/or comprising more affluent resident populations. Emissions were also shown to increase with school year, with larger step changes between educational stages reflecting the different geography of school locations. Furthermore, where secondary school entry policies were selective or based on a religious domination, average emissions were typically higher than in non-selective schools.},

abstract = {Introduced in its contemporary form in 1946 (ref. 1), but with roots that go back to the eighteenth century, the gravity law is the prevailing framework with which to predict population movement, cargo shipping volume and inter-city phone calls, as well as bilateral trade flows between nations. Despite its widespread use, it relies on adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and suffers from known analytic inconsistencies. Here we introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and mobility fluxes that require as input only information on the population distribution. The resulting radiation model predicts mobility patterns in good agreement with mobility and transport patterns observed in a wide range of phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to communication volume between different regions. Given its parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of most of the phenomena affected by mobility and transport processes.},

abstract = {Background Increasing active travel (walking, cycling, public transport) is increasingly seen as integral to strategies to raise physical activity levels. Purpose This study examined (1) sociodemographic correlates of active travel to work and (2) associations between active travel and cardiovascular risk factors in the United Kingdom (UK). Methods Data come from Understanding Society, a nationally representative survey of UK residents in 2009/2011, analyzed in 2012. Multinomial logistic regression assessed associations between sociodemographic factors and mode of transport to work. Linear and logistic regression was used to examine associations between mode of travel and overweight/obesity, and having hypertension or diabetes. Results A total of 69\% of participants traveled to work using private transport, with public transport, walking, and cycling used by 16\%, 12\%, and 3\%, respectively. Use of any active travel was more likely in participants living in London. Black participants were more likely to walk (AOR=1.41, 95\% CI=1.08, 1.84) or take public transport (AOR=2.34, 95\% CI=1.88, 2.90) to work than whites. Using public transport, walking, or cycling to work was associated with a lower likelihood of being overweight (AOR=0.80, 95\% CI=0.54, 0.88 for walking). Walking or cycling was associated with a lower likelihood of having diabetes, and walking was associated with a lower likelihood of having hypertension than private transport (AOR=0.83, 95\% CI=0.71, 0.97). Conclusions There are wide variations in the mode of travel to work across regions and sociodemographic groups in the UK. The protective association between active travel and cardiovascular risk demonstrated in this nationally representative study adds to growing evidence that concerted policy focus in this area may benefit population health. ?? 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

abstract = {To address the speeding problem in residential areas, the City of Edmonton initiated a pilot project to reduce the posted speed limit from 50km/h to 40km/h within six residential communities. This paper investigates the community perceptions of traffic safety within the six pilot communities in two phases: prior to project initiation (pre-pilot) and following the end of the project (post-pilot). This objective was accomplished by analyzing the results of two random dialing telephone surveys comprising 300 residents each. A preliminary analysis showed compatible demographic configurations for the two samples and confirmed that the residents were aware of both the posted speed limits and the adopted speed management controls. For the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a two-group (pre-pilot and post-pilot) three-factor model was used to assess the residents' perceptions of the speeding behavior (Speeding), their concerns about traffic safety issues (Concerns), and their perceptions of traffic safety (Safety). Comparing the CFA results of the post-pilot survey versus those of the pre-pilot survey, it was evident that there was a significant decrease in Speeding and Concerns accompanied by a significant increase in Safety. A structural equations model (SEM) was also fitted to the data in order to assess the impact of Speeding and Concerns on Safety. The results showed that Concerns increase significantly with Speeding, and that both factors have significant negative impacts on Safety. However, while the impact of Concerns on Safety was direct, that of Speeding on Safety was largely indirect (i.e., mediated through Concerns). Overall, the multivariate analysis has demonstrated that the pilot project was successful in improving the residents' perceptions of traffic safety in their community.},

METHOD: Review of the literature of medical, public health, city planning, public administration and traffic engineering.

RESULTS: The real and perceived danger and discomfort imposed by traffic discourage walking and bicycling. Accurately or not, pedestrians and bicyclists judge injury risk and respond accordingly. Although it can be difficult to measure these effects, observed behaviour provides good evidence for these effects, with the strongest association being an inverse correlation between volumes and speeds of traffic and levels of walking and cycling.

CONCLUSION: Interventions to reduce traffic speed and volume are likely to promote walking and bicycling and thus result in public health gains.},

a population shift from using cars towards walking and cycling and
to assess the health effects of such interventions. Data sources
Published and unpublished reports in any language identified from
electronic databases, bibliographies, websites, and reference lists.
Review methods Systematic search and appraisal to identify experimental
or observational studies with a prospective or controlled retrospective
design that evaluated any intervention applied to an urban population
or area by measuring outcomes in members of the local population.
Results 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. We found some evidence
that targeted behaviour change programmes can change the behaviour
of motivated subgroups, resulting (in the largest study) in a shift
of around 5\% of all trips at a population level. Single studies of
commuter subsidies and a new railway station also showed positive
effects. The balance of best available evidence about publicity campaigns,
engineering measures, and other interventions suggests that they
have not been effective. Participants in trials of active commuting
experienced short term improvements in certain measures of health
and fitness, but we found no good evidence on effects on health of
any effective intervention at population level. Conclusions The best
available evidence of effectiveness in promoting a modal shift is
for targeted behaviour change programmes, but the social distribution
of their effects is unclear and some other types of intervention
have yet to be rigorously evaluated.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the potential for making deep cuts in US transportation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the long-term (50-80\% below 1990 levels by 2050). Scenarios are used to envision how such a significant decarbonization might be achieved through the application of advanced vehicle technologies and fuels, and various options for behavioral change. A Kaya framework that decomposes GHG emissions into the product of four major drivers is used to analyze emissions and mitigation options. In contrast to most previous studies, a relatively simple, easily adaptable modeling methodology is used which can incorporate insights from other modeling studies and organize them in a way that is easy for policymakers to understand. Also, a wider range of transportation subsectors is considered here-light- and heavy-duty vehicles, aviation, rail, marine, agriculture, off-road, and construction. This analysis investigates scenarios with multiple options (increased efficiency, lower-carbon fuels, and travel demand management) across the various subsectors and confirms the notion that there are no "silver bullet" strategies for making deep cuts in transport GHGs. If substantial emission reductions are to be made, considerable action is needed on all fronts, and no subsectors can be ignored. Light-duty vehicles offer the greatest potential for emission reductions; however, while deep reductions in other subsectors are also possible, there are more limitations in the types of fuels and propulsion systems that can be used. In all cases travel demand management strategies are critical; deep emission cuts will not likely be possible without slowing growth in travel demand across all modes. Even though these scenarios represent only a small subset of the potential futures in which deep reductions might be achieved, they provide a sense of the magnitude of changes required in our transportation system and the need for early and aggressive action if long-term targets are to be met. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing active travel (walking, bicycling, and public transport) is promoted as a key strategy to increase physical activity and reduce the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) globally. Little is known about patterns of active travel or associated cardiovascular health benefits in low- and middle-income countries. This study examines mode and duration of travel to work in rural and urban India and associations between active travel and overweight, hypertension, and diabetes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Cross-sectional study of 3,902 participants (1,366 rural, 2,536 urban) in the Indian Migration Study. Associations between mode and duration of active travel and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed using random-effect logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, caste, standard of living, occupation, factory location, leisure time physical activity, daily fat intake, smoking status, and alcohol use. Rural dwellers were significantly more likely to bicycle (68.3\% versus 15.9\%; p<0.001) to work than urban dwellers. The prevalence of overweight or obesity was 50.0\%, 37.6\%, 24.2\%, 24.9\%; hypertension was 17.7\%, 11.8\%, 6.5\%, 9.8\%; and diabetes was 10.8\%, 7.4\%, 3.8\%, 7.3\% in participants who travelled to work by private transport, public transport, bicycling, and walking, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, those walking (adjusted risk ratio [ARR] 0.72; 95\% CI 0.58-0.88) or bicycling to work (ARR 0.66; 95\% CI 0.55-0.77) were significantly less likely to be overweight or obese than those travelling by private transport. Those bicycling to work were significantly less likely to have hypertension (ARR 0.51; 95\% CI 0.36-0.71) or diabetes (ARR 0.65; 95\% CI 0.44-0.95). There was evidence of a dose-response relationship between duration of bicycling to work and being overweight, having hypertension or diabetes. The main limitation of the study is the cross-sectional design, which limits causal inference for the associations found.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Walking and bicycling to work was associated with reduced cardiovascular risk in the Indian population. Efforts to increase active travel in urban areas and halt declines in rural areas should be integral to strategies to maintain healthy weight and prevent NCDs in India.

@article{Stefanidis2013,
abstract = {Social media generated from many individuals is playing a greater role in our daily lives and provides a unique opportunity to gain valuable insight on information flow and social networking within a society. Through data collection and analysis of its content, it supports a greater mapping and understanding of the evolving human landscape. The information disseminated through such media represents a deviation from volunteered geography, in the sense that it is not geographic information per se. Nevertheless, the message often has geographic footprints, for example, in the form of locations from where the tweets originate, or references in their content to geographic entities. We argue that such data conveys ambient geospatial information, capturing for example, people’s references to locations that represent momentary social hotspots. In this paper we address a framework to harvest such ambient geospatial information, and resulting hybrid capabilities to analyze it to support situational awareness as it relates to human activities. We argue that this emergence of ambient geospatial analysis represents a second step in the evolution of geospatial data availability, following on the heels of volunteered geographical information.},

@article{Vandenbulcke2014,
abstract = {This paper aims at predicting cycling accident risk for an entire network and identifying how road infrastructure influences cycling safety in the Brussels-Capital Region (Belgium). A spatial Bayesian modelling approach is proposed using a binary dependent variable (accident, no accident at location i) constructed from a case-control strategy. Control sites are sampled along the 'bikeable' road network in function of the potential bicycle traffic transiting in each ward. Risk factors are limited to infrastructure, traffic and environmental characteristics. Results suggest that a high risk is statistically associated with the presence of on-road tram tracks, bridges without cycling facility, complex intersections, proximity to shopping centres or garages, and busy van and truck traffic. Cycle facilities built at intersections and parked vehicles located next to separated cycle facilities are also associated with an increased risk, whereas contraflow cycling is associated with a reduced risk. The cycling accident risk is far from being negligible in points where there is actually no reported cycling accident but where they are yet expected to occur. Hence, mapping predicted accident risks provides planners and policy makers with a useful tool for accurately locating places with a high potential risk even before accidents actually happen. This also provides comprehensible information for orienting cyclists to the safest routes in Brussels.},

Each case was summarized on a database including the main objective features (such as time and place), a summary narrative, a sketch plan and a list of explanatory factors. The main findings were that older drivers have significant problems with intersection collisions and failing to give right of way; these formed the largest single class of crashes in the sample. Possible behavioural explanations for this will be discussed, along with other findings regarding older driver blameworthiness, fatigue and illness, time of day factors, and 'unintended accelerations'.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal clustering is a process of grouping objects based on their spatial and temporal similarity. It is relatively new subfield of data mining which gained high popularity especially in geographic information sciences due to the pervasiveness of all kinds of location-based or environmental devices that record position, time or/and environmental properties of an object or set of objects in real-time. As a consequence, different types and large amounts of spatio-temporal data became available that introduce new challenges to data analysis and require novel approaches to knowledge discovery. In this chapter we concentrate on the spatio-temporal clustering in geographic space. First, we provide a classification of different types of spatio-temporal data. Then, we focus on one type of spatio-temporal clustering - trajectory clustering, provide an overview of the state-of-the-art approaches and methods of spatio-temporal clustering and finally present several scenarios in different application domains such as movement, cellular networks and environmental studies.},

abstract = {Transport planning, infrastructure project evaluation and policy making, particularly at the urban level, continue to be important issues in the 21st century. Transport modelling requires mathematical techniques in order to make predictions, which can then be utilised in planning and design. This is the basis for improved decision-making and planning in the transport arena. Building on the tremendous success of the previous editions, the new Modelling Transport continues to be the state of the art text in its field. As before, this third edition provides comprehensive and rigorous information and guidance, enabling readers to make practical use of every available technique. Presenting the following features: * A substantially updated section on data collection techniques * An examination of the latest topical modelling approaches, including new material on Probit Model estimation (now possible in practice) and Mixed Logit specification and estimation * New treatment of joint time-of-travel and assignment modelling * Significant new material on Stated Preferences * Added coverage of travel time valuation and, importantly, of the valuation of externalities such as accidents and environmental effects This book is the leader in its subject area, and gives the reader a unique contemporary account of key transport modelling techniques and applications. As before, each subject is approached as a modelling exercise with discussion of the roles of theory, data, model specification, estimation, validation and application. Techniques are included for selecting the right level of analysis and detail for modelling purposes, as well as how to adapt existing tools to serve the needs of regular updating of models and plans. Graduate and postgraduate students in transport engineering and planning, practicing transport engineers, consultants, planners and professional societies, as well as government agencies and district and city councils will find this an essential and valuable text.},

abstract = {We used Comparative Risk Assessment methods to estimate the health effects of alternative urban land transport scenarios for two settings-London, UK, and Delhi, India. For each setting, we compared a business-as-usual 2030 projection (without policies for reduction of greenhouse gases) with alternative scenarios-lower-carbon-emission motor vehicles, increased active travel, and a combination of the two. We developed separate models that linked transport scenarios with physical activity, air pollution, and risk of road traffic injury. In both cities, we noted that reduction in carbon dioxide emissions through an increase in active travel and less use of motor vehicles had larger health benefits per million population (7332 disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] in London, and 12 516 in Delhi in 1 year) than from the increased use of lower-emission motor vehicles (160 DALYs in London, and 1696 in Delhi). However, combination of active travel and lower-emission motor vehicles would give the largest benefits (7439 DALYs in London, 12 995 in Delhi), notably from a reduction in the number of years of life lost from ischaemic heart disease (10-19\% in London, 11-25\% in Delhi). Although uncertainties remain, climate change mitigation in transport should benefit public health substantially. Policies to increase the acceptability, appeal, and safety of active urban travel, and discourage travel in private motor vehicles would provide larger health benefits than would policies that focus solely on lower-emission motor vehicles.},

abstract = {Behavioral economics tells us that emotions can profoundly affect individual behavior and decision-making. Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 86.7\% in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) by more than 6\%. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The replication of important findings by multiple independent investigators is fundamental to the accumulation of scientific evidence. Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is "reproducibility," which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health.},

@article{Wegman2012,
abstract = {This paper discusses the current level of the road safety problems of cycling and cyclists, why cyclists run relatively high risks, and why cyclists may be considered as 'vulnerable road users'. This paper is based on peer-reviewed research which give some idea how to reduce the number of cyclist casualties. However, this research is rather limited and the results cannot (easily) be transferred from one setting or country to another: generalization of results should only be done with the utmost care, if it is to be done at all. Interventions to reduce cyclist casualties worldwide seem to be of an incidental nature; that is to say, they are implemented in a rather isolated way. In a Safe System approach, such as the Dutch Sustainable Safety vision, the inherent risks of traffic are dealt with in a systematic, proactive way. We illustrate how this approach is especially effective for vulnerable road users, such as cyclists. Finally, the paper addresses the question of whether it is possible to make more cycling good for road safety. We conclude that when the number of cyclists increases, the number of fatalities may increase, but will not necessarily do so, and the outcome is dependent on specific conditions. There is strong evidence that well-designed bicycle facilities-physically separated networks-reduce risks for cyclists, and therefore have an impact on the net safety result, for example if car-kilometres are substituted by bicycle kilometres. Policies to support cycling should incorporate these findings in order to make more cycling good for road safety.},

@article{Thornley2008,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the methods, characteristics of participants, and report on the preliminary findings of a longitudinal study of cyclists.

DESIGN: Web-based survey to establish a cohort of cyclists.

SETTING: Participants in the largest mass-participation bicycle event in New Zealand, the Wattyl Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge.

PARTICIPANTS: 2469 riders who had enrolled online in the 2006 Wattyl Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported crashes in preceding 12 months.

RESULTS: Of 5653 eligible riders, 2469 (44\%) completed the study questionnaire. Mean age was 44 years, 73\% were male, and the average number of kilometers cycled per week in the preceding 12 months was 130. The annual incidence of crashes leading to injury that disrupted usual daily activities for at least 24 h was 0.5 per cyclist/year. About one-third of these crashes resulted in presentation to a health professional. The mean number of days absent from work attributable to bicycle crashes was 0.39 per cyclist/year. After adjustment for potential confounders and exposure (kilometers cycled per year), the rate of days off work from bicycle crash injury was substantially lower among riders who reported always wearing fluorescent colors (multivariate incidence rate ratio 0.23, 95\% CI 0.09 to 0.59).

CONCLUSIONS: Low cyclist conspicuity may increase the risk of crash-related injury and subsequent time off work. Increased use of high-visibility clothing is a simple intervention that may have a large impact on the safety of cycling.},

I published the first note proposing H2 storage and transmission of energy phis use of fuel cells as the general solution to climate environmental decay in 1971, a full paper in 1972 and the first book in 1975. H2 would be used instead of natural gas in industry, particularly in metallurgical extractions and in the home. To extract H2 from water at 2020 would be 20\% more expensive than present gasoline — if one allows the pollutional costs of gasoline to be taken into account.},

abstract = {The daily trip to work is ubiquitous, yet its characteristics differ widely from person to person and place to place. This is manifested in statistics on mode and distance of travel, which vary depending on a range of factors that operate at different scales. This heterogeneity is problematic for decision makers tasked with encouraging more sustainable commuter patterns. Numerical models, based on real commuting data, have great potential to aid the decision making process. However, we contend that new approaches are needed to advance knowledge about the social and geographical factors that relate to the diversity of commuter patterns, if policies targeted to specific individuals or places are to be effective. To this end, the paper presents a spatial microsimulation approach, which combines individual-level survey data with geographically aggregated census results to tackle the problem. This method overcomes the limitations imposed by the lack of available geocoded micro-data. Further, it allows a range of scales of analysis to be pursued in parallel and provides insights into both the types of area and individual that would benefit most from specific interventions.},

abstract = {Walkability audits provide valuable information about pedestrian environments, but are time-consuming and can be expensive to implement. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to select sites for conducting walkability audits. The key idea is to estimate a model of travel behavior at the meso-scale level, which can be examined to identify locations where the behavior is under- and over-estimated. We conjecture that systematic under- and over-estimation can be caused by micro-level factors that influence the behavior. The results can be used to identify sites for walkability audits. The approach is demonstrated with a case study in Hamilton, Canada. A model of walk shares forms the basis of the site selection procedure. After identifying areas with higher and lower shares than predicted by the model we select a sample of neighborhoods for audits. Analysis of the results reveals elements of the local environment that associate with greater-than-expected walk shares. The case study demonstrates that the proposed model-based strategy can be used to better target limited resources, and produce valuable insights into micro-level factors that affect travel behavior.},

abstract = {Global Positioning System devices are increasingly being used for data collection in many fields. Consumer-grade GPS units without differential correction have a published horizontal positional accuracy of approximately 10–15 m (average positional accuracy). An attractive option for differential correction for these GPS units is the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). Most consumer-grade GPS units on the market are WAAS capable. According to the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), the WAAS broadcast message provides integrity information about the GPS signal as well as accuracy improvements, which are reported to improve accuracy to 3–5 m. Limited empirical evidence has been published on the accuracy of WAAS-enabled GPS compared to autonomous GPS. An empirical study was conducted comparing the horizontal and vertical accuracy of WAAS-corrected GPS and autonomous GPS under ideal conditions using consumer-grade receivers. Data were collected for 30-min time spans over accurately surveyed control points. Metrics of median, 68th and 95th percentile, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and average positional accuracy in the horizontal and vertical dimensions were computed and statistically compared. No statistically significant difference was found between WAAS and autonomous position fixes when using two different consumer-grade units. When using WAAS, a third unit type exhibited a statistically significant improvement in positional accuracy. Analysis of data collected for a 27-h time span indicates that while WAAS is altering the estimated position of a point compared to an autonomous position estimate, WAAS augmentation actually appears to decrease the positional accuracy.},

abstract = {This is the first modern edition and first English translation of one of the earliest and most important works in the history of geography, the third-century Geographika of Eratosthenes. In this work, which for the first time described the geography of the entire inhabited world as it was then known, Eratosthenes of Kyrene (ca. 285-205 BC) invented the discipline of geography as we understand it. A polymath who served as librarian at Alexandria and tutor to the future King Ptolemy IV, Eratosthenes created the terminology of geography, probably including the word geographia itself. Building on his previous work, in which he determined the size and shape of the earth, Eratosthenes in the Geographika created a grid of parallels and meridians that linked together every place in the world: for the first time one could figure out the relationship and distance between remote localities, such as northwest Africa and the Caspian Sea. The Geographika also identified some four hundred places, more than ever before, from Thoule (probably Iceland) to Taprobane (Sri Lanka), and from well down the coast of Africa to Central Asia. This is the first collation of the more than 150 fragments of the Geographika in more than a century. Each fragment is accompanied by an English translation, a summary, and commentary. Duane W. Roller provides a rich background, including a history of the text and its reception, a biography of Eratosthenes, and a comprehensive account of ancient Greek geographical thought and of Eratosthenes' pioneering contribution to it. This edition also includes maps that show all of the known places named in the Geographika, appendixes, a bibliography, and indexes.},

The European Commission estimates that ELVs contribute to approximately 1 \% of the total waste in Europe [9]. Other European Union strategies are considering more life cycle aspects, as well as other impacts including resource or climate change. This article is summarizing the results of a European Commission funded project (LIRECAR) that aims at identifying the environmental impacts and relevance for combinations of recycling / recovery and lightweight vehicle design options over the whole life cycle of a vehicle - i.e. manufacturing, use and recycling/recovery. Three, independent and scientific LCA experts reviewed the study according to ISO 14040. From the beginning, representatives of all Life Cycle Stakeholders have been involved (European materials \& supplier associations, an environmental Non-Governmental Organization, recycler’s association).},

abstract = {Background: Evidence of associations between active transportation (walking and bicycling for transportation) and health outcomes is limited. Better understanding of this relationship would inform efforts to increase physical activity by promoting active transportation. Purpose: This study examined associations between active transportation and cardiovascular disease risk factors in U.S. adults. Methods: Using the 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), adults (N=9933) were classified by level of active transportation. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, smoking status, and minutes/week of non-active transportation physical activity. Analyses were conducted in 2011. Results: Overall, 76\% reported no active transportation. Compared with no active transportation, mean BMI was lower among individuals with low (-0.9, 95\% CI= -1.4, -0.5) and high (-1.2, 95\% CI= -1.7, -0.8) levels of active transportation. Mean waist circumference was lower in the low (-2.2 cm, 95\% CI= -3.2, -1.2) and high (-3.1 cm, 95\% CI= -4.3, -1.9) active transportation groups. The odds of hypertension were 24\% lower (AOR=0.76, 95\% CI=0.61, 0.94) and 31\% lower (AOR=0.69, 95\% CI=0.58, 0.83) among individuals with low and high levels of active transportation, respectively, compared with no active transportation. High active transportation was associated with 31\% lower odds of diabetes (AOR=0.69, 95\% CI=0.54, 0.88). Active transportation was not associated with high-density lipoprotein level. Conclusions: Active transportation was associated with more-favorable cardiovascular risk factor profiles, providing additional justification for infrastructure and policies that permit and encourage active transportation. ?? 2012 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active transport policies are being developed across Europe designed to have health and environmental benefits. There is little evidence of impact on physical activity of active transport strategies which modify the built environment. Cycling represents one virtually carbon-neutral form of transport that can help to address declining levels of exercise.

METHODS: A systematic literature review of experimental or observational studies that objectively evaluated the effect of the built environment on cycling.

RESULTS: A total of 21 studies met the inclusion criteria, all of which were observational studies. Eleven studies identified objectively measured environmental factors with a significant positive association with cycling. The environmental factors identified as being positively associated with cycling included presence of dedicated cycle routes or paths, separation of cycling from other traffic, high population density, short trip distance, proximity of a cycle path or green space and for children projects promoting 'safe routes to school'. Negative environmental factors were perceived and objective traffic danger, long trip distance, steep inclines and distance from cycle paths. Of the seven studies which focused primarily on the impact of cycle routes, four demonstrated a statistically significant positive association.

CONCLUSION: Although the study identified environmental factors with positive and negative associations with cycling behaviour, many other types of environmental policies and interventions have yet to be rigorously evaluated. Policies promoting cycle lane construction appear promising but the socio-demographic distribution of their effects on physical activity is unclear. The wider impact of active transport policies on health and inequalities across Europe must be explored.},

Policy needs to be based on evidence about people's views of walking and cycling as well as effects of interventions. METHODS: Studies of the views of children, young people and parents about walking and cycling were searched for systematically, and a framework analysis applied. The findings were synthesised and compared with the findings of an effectiveness review of interventions for encouraging walking and cycling as an alternative to motorised transport. RESULTS: The synthesis of views described a culture of car use, fed by a fear and dislike of local environments and parental responses that emphasised children's safety at the expense of developing their independence, despite children expressing responsible attitudes towards transport choices. Comparison with effectiveness literature found that most evaluated interventions targeted only the public's fear and dislike of local environments. CONCLUSION: Interventions need to address pedestrian and cyclist safety, perceptions of risk, and parental norms regarding children's independence.},

abstract = {The proximity and speed of motor traffic passing cyclists in non-separated conditions may be so close and so great as to cause discomfort. A variety of road design and driver behaviour factors may affect overtaking speeds and distances. The investigation presented in this paper builds on previous research and fills gaps in that research by considering the presence of cycle lanes on 20mph and 30mph roads, different lane widths, different lane markings, vehicle type, vehicle platooning and oncoming traffic. Data were collected from a bicycle ridden a distance of one metre from the kerb fitted with an ultrasonic distance detector and forward and sideways facing cameras. Reduced overtaking speeds correlate with narrower lanes, lower speed limits, and the absence of centre-line markings. Drivers passed slower if driving a long vehicle, driving in a platoon, and when approaching vehicles in the opposing carriageway were within five seconds of the passing point. Increased passing distances were found where there were wider or dual lane roads, and in situations where oncoming vehicles were further away and not in a platoon. In mixed traffic conditions, cyclists will be better accommodated by wider cross-sections, lower speed limits and the removal of the centre-line marking.},

@article{Ramanathan2005,
abstract = {Energy is consumed both by passenger and freight traffic, and it is
generally not possible to apportion energy consumption exclusively
to either of the traffic without making restrictive assumptions on
the energy consumption norms of vehicles. The use of data envelopment
analysis (DEA) has been suggested earlier in the literature for comparing
energy efficiencies without requiring any such restrictive assumptions.
In this paper, the applicability of DEA is further extended to estimate
energy consumption of rail and/or road transport that would result
in a pre-specified DEA efficiency. Using this new approach, effects
of capturing some modal split in favour of rail transport on future
energy consumption and emissions of carbon dioxide are presented
in the paper via a scenario analysis. It is shown that if rail could
capture 50\% modal share in the years 2005-2006 and 2020-2021, it
would save nearly 35\% energy consumption and emissions compared to
the situation when existing patterns of modal split are allowed to
continue without policy intervention.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to update the evidence on the health benefits of cycling. A systematic review of the literature resulted in 16 cycling-specific studies. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies showed a clear positive relationship between cycling and cardiorespiratory fitness in youths. Prospective observational studies demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between commuter cycling and all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, and cancer morbidity among middle-aged to elderly subjects. Intervention studies among working-age adults indicated consistent improvements in cardiovascular fitness and some improvements in cardiovascular risk factors due to commuting cycling. Six studies showed a consistent positive dose-response gradient between the amount of cycling and the health benefits. Systematic assessment of the quality of the studies showed most of them to be of moderate to high quality. According to standard criteria used primarily for the assessment of clinical studies, the strength of this evidence was strong for fitness benefits, moderate for benefits in cardiovascular risk factors, and inconclusive for all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality, cancer risk, and overweight and obesity. While more intervention research is needed to build a solid knowledge base of the health benefits of cycling, the existing evidence reinforces the current efforts to promote cycling as an important contributor for better population health.},

abstract = {Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), also known as biproportional fitting, ‘raking’ or the RAS algorithm, is an established procedure used in a variety of applications across the social sciences. Primary amongst these for urban modelling has been its use in static spatial microsimulation to generate small area microdata — individual level data allocated to administrative zones. The technique is mature, widely used and relatively straight-forward. Although IPF is well described mathematically, accessible examples of the algorithm written in modern programming languages are rare. There is a tendency for researchers to ‘start from scratch’, resulting in a variety of ad hoc implementations and little evidence about the relative merits of differing approaches. These knowledge gaps mean that answers to certain methodological questions must be guessed: How can ‘empty cells’ be identified and how do they influence model fit? Can IPF be made more computationally efficient? This paper tackles these questions and more using a systematic methodology with publicly available code and data. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to initial conditions, notably the presence of ‘empty cells’, and the dramatic impact of software decisions on computational efficiency. The paper concludes by proposing an agenda for robust and transparent future tests in the field.},

abstract = {The use of bicycle is substantially affected by the weather patterns, which is expected to change in the future as a result of climate change. It is therefore important to understand the resulting potential changes in bicycle flows in order to accommodate adaptation planning for cycling. We propose a framework to model the changes in bicycle flow in London by developing a negative binomial count-data model and by incorporating future projected weather data from downscaled global climate models, a first such approach in this area. High temporal resolution (hourly) of our model allows us to decipher changes not only on an annual basis, but also on a seasonal and daily basis. We find that there will be a modest 0.5\% increase in the average annual hourly bicycle flows in London's network due to a changed climate. The increase is primarily driven by a higher temperature due to a changed climate, although the increase is tempered due to a higher rainfall. The annual average masks the differences of impacts between seasons though - bicycle flows are expected to increase during the summer and winter months (by 1.6\%), decrease during the spring (by 2\%) and remain nearly unchanged during the autumn. Leisure cycling will be more affected by a changed climate, with an increase of around 7\% during the weekend and holiday cycle flows in the summer months. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This investigation described the effects of exercise, walking, and cycling for transportation, as well as the effect of overall nonexercise physical activity, on mortality in the Shanghai Women's Health Study (1997-2004). Women without heart disease, stroke, or cancer were followed for an average of 5.7 years (n = 67,143), and there were 1,091 deaths from all causes, 537 deaths from cancer, and 251 deaths from cardiovascular diseases. Information about physical activity and relevant covariates was obtained by interview. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals. Exercise and cycling for transportation were both inversely and independently associated with all-cause mortality (p(trend) < 0.05), but walking for transportation was less strongly associated with reduced risk (p(trend) = 0.07). Women reporting no regular exercise but who reported 10 or more metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/day of nonexercise activity were at 25-50\% reduced risk (p(trend) < 0.01) relative to less active women (0-9.9 MET-hours/day). Among women reporting the least nonexercise activity (0-9.9 MET-hours/day) but reporting regular exercise participation, exercise was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio = 0.78, 95\% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.99). These findings add new evidence that overall physical activity levels are an important determinant of longevity, and that health benefit can be obtained through an active lifestyle, exercise, or combinations of both.},

abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity plays a role in the acquisition of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and breast and colon cancer. The impact of such noncommunicable diseases on low- and middle-income countries is a major global health concern, but most studies in this area have focused on high-income countries. A better understanding of the factors that may influence physical activity in low- and middle-income countries is needed. Purpose: This study describes the prevalence of cycling and walking for transportation and their association with personal and environmental factors in adults from three state capitals in Brazil. Methods: In 2007-2009, a random-digit-dialing telephone survey was conducted with residents (aged ≥18 years) of Curitiba, Vitoria, and Recife, sampled through a clustered multistage sampling process. Walking and cycling for transportation, perception of the environment related to physical activity, and demographic and health characteristics were collected. Poisson regression was used to examine associations between cycling and walking for transportation with covariates stratified by cities. All analyses were conducted in 2011. Results: The prevalence of bicycling for transportation was 13.4\%; higher in Recife (16.0\%; 95\% CI=13.7, 18.4) compared to Curitiba (9.6\%; 95\% CI=7.8, 11.4) and Vitoria (8.8\%; 95\% CI=7.34, 10.1); and 26.6\% for walking regularly as a mode of transportation. The adjusted analysis showed that cycling is positively associated with being male (prevalence OR [pOR]=3.4; 95\% CI=2.6, 18.4) and younger (pOR=2.9; 95\% CI=1.8, 4.9) and inversely associated with having a college degree (pOR=0.3; 95\% CI=0.2, 0.4). Walking for transportation is inversely associated with having a college degree (pOR=0.6; 95\% CI=0.5, 0.8). No strong evidence of association was found of environmental indicators with walking or bicycling. Conclusions: The prevalence of active commuting was low and varied by city. Personal factors were more consistently associated with bicycling than with walking, whereas perceived environmental features were not related to active commuting. © 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

Real-life examples are a group of migrating ani- mals, a convoy of cars moving in a city, etc. We study the discovery of moving clusters in a database of object trajectories. The difference of this problem com- pared to clustering trajectories and mining movement patterns is that the identity of amoving cluster remains unchanged while its location and contentmay change over time. For example, while a group of animals are migrating, some animals may leave the group or new animals may enter it.We provide a formal definition for moving clusters and describe three algorithms for their automatic discovery: (i) a straight-forward method based on the definition, (ii) a more efficientmethod which avoids redundant checks and (iii) an approximate algorithm which trades accuracy for speed by borrowing ideas from the MPEG-2 video encoding. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our techniques and their appli- cability to large spatio-temporal datasets.},

This paper presents an extension to the current methodology that accounts for increased demand and a carbon pinch analysis of the New Zealand electricity industry while illustrating some of the issues with realising meaningful emissions reductions. The current large proportion of renewable generation (67\% in 2007) complicates extensive reduction of carbon emissions from electricity generation. The largest growth in renewable generation is expected to come from geothermal generation followed by wind and hydro. A four fold increase in geothermal generation capacity is needed in addition to large amounts of new wind generation to reduce emissions to around 1990 levels and also meet projected demand. The expected expansion of geothermal generation in New Zealand raises issues of GHG emissions from the geothermal fields. The emissions factors between fields can vary by almost two orders of magnitude making predictions of total emissions highly site specific. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

geography and their different research and publication practices.
Relatively little data about these are available, however. Using
an analysis of all publications submitted by UK geographers to the
2001 Research Assessment Exercise, this paper identifies a substantial
difference between human and physical geographers in their publication
strategies. Most physical geographers place their research papers
in specialized inter-disciplinary journals and make relatively little
use of geography outlets: most human geographers, on the other hand,
publish in geography journals. Comparisons with other disciplines
- in the earth and environmental and social sciences respectively
- also identify differences between geographers and their peers.
The overall conclusion is that, with regard to research and publication
at least, UK geography cannot be presented as a single academic community
with strong internal ties, but rather as a conglomerate of separate
communities writing for different audiences.},

abstract = {We present a new technique for the visual exploration of origins (O) and destinations (D) arranged in geographic space. Previous attempts to map the flows between origins and destinations have suffered from problems of occlusion usually requiring some form of generalisation, such as aggregation or flow density estimation before they can be visualized. This can lead to loss of detail or the introduction of arbitrary artefacts in the visual representation. Here, we propose mapping OD vectors as cells rather than lines, comparable with the process of constructing OD matrices, but unlike the OD matrix, we preserve the spatial layout of all origin and destination locations by constructing a gridded two-level spatial treemap. The result is a set of spatially ordered small multiples upon which any arbitrary geographic data may be projected. Using a hash grid spatial data structure, we explore the characteristics of the technique through a software prototype that allows interactive query and visualisation of 105–106 simulated and recorded OD vectors. The technique is illustrated using US county to county migration and commuting statistics.},

abstract = {ISSUE ADDRESSED: Overseas research shows that fatality and injury risks per cyclist and pedestrian are lower when there are more cyclists and pedestrians. Do Australian data follow the same exponential 'growth rule' where (Injuries)/(Amount of cycling) is proportional to ((Amount of cycling)-0.6)?

METHOD: Fatality and injury risks were compared using three datasets: 1) fatalities and amounts of cycling in Australian States in the 1980s; 2) fatality and injury rates over time in Western Australia as cycling levels increased; and 3) deaths, serious head injuries and other serious injuries to cyclists and pedestrians in Victoria, before and after the fall in cycling with the helmet law.

RESULTS: In Australia, the risks of fatality and injury per cyclist are lower when cycling is more prevalent. Cycling was safest and most popular in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Queensland and Western Australia (WA). New South Wales residents cycled only 47\% as much as residents of Queensland and WA, but had 53\% more fatalities per kilometre, consistent with the growth rule prediction of 52\% more for half as much cycling. Cycling also became safer in WA as more people cycled. Hospitalisation rates per 10,000 regular cyclists fell from 29 to 15, and reported deaths and serious injuries from 5.6 to 3.8 as numbers of regular cyclists increased. In Victoria, after the introduction of compulsory helmets, there was a 30\% reduction in cycling and it was associated with a higher risk of death or serious injury per cyclist, outweighing any benefits of increased helmet wearing.

CONCLUSIONS: As with overseas data, the exponential growth rule fits Australian data well. If cycling doubles, the risk per kilometre falls by about 34\%; conversely, if cycling halves, the risk per kilometre will be about 52\% higher. Policies that adversely influence the amount of cycling (for example, compulsory helmet legislation) should be reviewed.},

abstract = {Increased cycling as a means of personal travel could generate environmental
benefits if associated with a corresponding decrease in car-based
transport. For promoting cycling during winter, the maintenance service
level of cycleways is of importance. Earlier studies indicated that
the Swedish public is unsatisfied with the service levels provided
on cycleways during winter. In Sweden, cycleways normally are cleared
of snow through plowing and are gritted for skid control. Field studies
tested an unconventional winter maintenance method that uses a power
broom for snow clearance and salt for deicing. The field studies
were evaluated through road-condition observations, measurements
of friction, a questionnaire survey, interviews, and bicycle measurements.
The method of using a power. broom for snow clearance and salt for
deicing provided a higher service level than traditional winter maintenance
methods, but it was two to three times more expensive. The method
has greater potential in regions, such as southern Sweden, with low
snow accumulations but with major ice-formation problems than in
regions with a colder climate. Cyclists noticed. the improved maintenance
service level provided with the method used in the field study, but
although cyclists stated that road condition is important to their
decision to cycle, it could not be concluded that the enhanced service
level generated a higher winter cycling frequency.},

abstract = {Bicycle sharing systems (bike-shares) are becoming increasingly popular in towns and cities around the world. They are viewed as a cheap, efficient, and healthy means of navigating dense urban environments. This paper is the first to take a global view of bike-sharing characteristics by analysing data from 38 systems located in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australasia and the Americas. To achieve this, an extensive database depicting the geographical location and bicycle occupancy of each docking station within a particular system has been created over a number of years to chart the usage in the chosen systems (and others) and provide a consistent basis on which to compare and classify them. Analysis of the variation of occupancy rates over time, and comparison across the system's extent, infers the likely demographics and intentions of user groups. A classification of bike-shares, based on the geographical footprint and diurnal, day-of-week and spatial variations in occupancy rates, is proposed. The knowledge of such patterns and characteristics identifiable from the dataset has a range of applications, including informing operators and policymakers about the maintenance of a suitable balance of bicycles throughout the system area (a nontrivial problem for many bike-shares), the location of new docking stations and cycle lanes, and better targeting of promotional materials to encourage new users. Within the context of transport research, the systems utilised here are part of relatively small, closed environments that can be more easily modelled and validated. Such work lays foundations for the analysis of larger scale transport systems by creating a classification of the different systems and seeks to demonstrate that bike-shares have a lot to offer both as an effective method of transport and a rich source of data. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Scientific literature lacks a model which combines exposure to risk, risk, and the relationship between them. This paper presents a conceptual road safety framework comprising mutually interacting factors for exposure to risk resulting from travel behaviour (volumes, modal split, and distribution of traffic over time and space) and for risk (crash and injury risk). The framework's three determinants for travel behaviour are locations of activities; resistances (generalized transport costs); needs, opportunities, and abilities. Crash and injury risks are modelled by the three 'safety pillars': infrastructure, road users and the vehicles they use. Creating a link in the framework between risk and exposure is important because of the 'non-linear relationship' between them, i.e. risk tends to decrease as exposure increases. Furthermore, 'perceived' risk (a type of travel resistance) plays a role in mode choice, i.e. the perception that a certain type of vehicle is unsafe can be a deterrent to its use. This paper uses theories to explain how the elements in the model interact. Cycling is an area where governments typically have goals for both mobility and safety. To exemplify application of the model, the paper uses the framework to link research on cycling (safety) to land use and infrastructure. The model's value lies in its ability to identify potential consequences of measures and policies for both exposure and risk. This is important from a scientific perspective and for policy makers who often have objectives for both mobility and safety.},

This paper uses a recently developed ITS performance assessment framework, i.e., Environmental Fusion (EnvFUSION), to perform dynamic forecasting of the performance for three key ITS technologies: active traffic management (ATM), intelligent speed adaptation (ISA), and an automated highway system (AHS) using a mathematical theory of evidence. A consequential lifecycle assessment (c-LCA) is undertaken, which forms part of a data fusion process using data from various sources. The models forecast improvements for the three ITS technologies in line with social acceptability, economic profitability, and major carbon reduction scenarios up to 2050 on one of the U.K.'s most congested highways. An analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) are used to weight criteria that form part of an intelligent transport sustainability index (ITSI). Overall performance is then synthesized. Results indicate that there will be a substantial increase in socioeconomic and emissions benefits, provided that the policies are in place and targets are reached, which would otherwise delay their realization.},

abstract = {In this Swedish study, the attitudes towards cycling during winter in general, and in relation to winter maintenance of cycleways in particular, is examined. Questionnaires were answered by a thousand employees at four major companies in two Swedish cities. There was a clear difference in mode choice between seasons. The number of car trips increased by 27\% from summer to winter while the number of bicycle trips decreased by 47\%. The number of car trips increased with distance while the number of bicycle trips decreased, and the decrease was even more significant in winter than in summer. There was a difference in opinion between different categories of cyclists, on what factors influenced the choice of transport mode for the journey to work. Temperature, precipitation, and road condition were the most important factors to those who cycled to work in summer but not in winter. Exercise was the most important to those who cycled frequently in winter, and travel time the most important to those who never cycled to work. By improving winter maintenance service levels on cycleways, it might be possible to increase the number of bicycle trips during winter by 18\%, representing a corresponding decrease in the number of car trips of 6\%. To increase cycling during winter, snow clearance was found to be the most important maintenance measure. Skid control was not considered as important for the choice of mode, although important to attend to for safety reasons. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Perceived cycling risk and route acceptability to potential users are obstacles to policy support for cycling and a better understanding of these issues will assist planners and decision makers. Two models of perceived risk, based on non-linear least squares, and a model of acceptability, based on the logit model, have been estimated for whole journeys based on responses from a sample of 144 commuters to video clips of routes and junctions. The risk models quantify the effect of motor traffic volumes, demonstrate that roundabouts add more to perceived risk than traffic signal controlled junctions and show that right turn manoeuvres increase perceived risk. Facilities for bicycle traffic along motor trafficked routes and at junctions are shown to have little effect on perceived risk and this brings into question the value of such facilities in promoting bicycle use. These models would assist in specifying infrastructure improvements, the recommending of least risk advisory routes and assessing accessibility for bicycle traffic. The acceptability model confirms the effect of reduced perceived risk in traffic free conditions and the effects of signal controlled junctions and right turns. The acceptability models, which may be used at an area wide level, would assist in assessing the potential demand for cycling and in target setting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing active travel (primarily walking and cycling) has been widely advocated for reducing obesity levels and achieving other population health benefits. However, the strength of evidence underpinning this strategy is unclear. This study aimed to assess the evidence that active travel has significant health benefits.

METHODS: The study design was a systematic review of (i) non-randomised and randomised controlled trials, and (ii) prospective observational studies examining either (a) the effects of interventions to promote active travel or (b) the association between active travel and health outcomes. Reports of studies were identified by searching 11 electronic databases, websites, reference lists and papers identified by experts in the field. Prospective observational and intervention studies measuring any health outcome of active travel in the general population were included. Studies of patient groups were excluded.

RESULTS: Twenty-four studies from 12 countries were included, of which six were studies conducted with children. Five studies evaluated active travel interventions. Nineteen were prospective cohort studies which did not evaluate the impact of a specific intervention. No studies were identified with obesity as an outcome in adults; one of five prospective cohort studies in children found an association between obesity and active travel. Small positive effects on other health outcomes were found in five intervention studies, but these were all at risk of selection bias. Modest benefits for other health outcomes were identified in five prospective studies. There is suggestive evidence that active travel may have a positive effect on diabetes prevention, which may be an important area for future research.

CONCLUSIONS: Active travel may have positive effects on health outcomes, but there is little robust evidence to date of the effectiveness of active transport interventions for reducing obesity. Future evaluations of such interventions should include an assessment of their impacts on obesity and other health outcomes.},

abstract = {Among the realistic ingredients to be considered in the computational modeling of infectious diseases, human mobility represents a crucial challenge both on the theoretical side and in view of the limited availability of empirical data. To study the interplay between short-scale commuting flows and long-range airline traffic in shaping the spatiotemporal pattern of a global epidemic we (i) analyze mobility data from 29 countries around the world and find a gravity model able to provide a global description of commuting patterns up to 300 kms and (ii) integrate in a worldwide-structured metapopulation epidemic model a timescale-separation technique for evaluating the force of infection due to multiscale mobility processes in the disease dynamics. Commuting flows are found, on average, to be one order of magnitude larger than airline flows. However, their introduction into the worldwide model shows that the large-scale pattern of the simulated epidemic exhibits only small variations with respect to the baseline case where only airline traffic is considered. The presence of short-range mobility increases, however, the synchronization of subpopulations in close proximity and affects the epidemic behavior at the periphery of the airline transportation infrastructure. The present approach outlines the possibility for the definition of layered computational approaches where different modeling assumptions and granularities can be used consistently in a unifying multiscale framework.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cycling to school may potentially increase physical activity level in sedentary children. Transport to school occur twice a day and could improve cardiovascular health in children. Commuter cycling is associated with lower mortality and cardiovascular disease rate in adults, but limited evidence exists in children. METHODS: Participants were 334 children (age 9.7 +/- 0.5 years) who were followed up 6 years later. Mode of travel to school was investigated by questionnaire. Cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors were compared by mode of travel to school both at baseline and at follow up and for subjects who changed mode of transportation. No difference was found between walkers and passive travelers, and these groups were merged in the analysis. RESULTS: A consistent pattern of better CVD risk factor profile in commuter cyclists compared with children using other means of transport was found. Participants, who did not cycle to school at baseline, and who had changed to cycling at follow up, were fitter, had better cholesterol/HDL ratio, better glucose metabolism, and a lower composite CVD risk factor score than those who did not cycle at either time point. CONCLUSION: Cycling to school may contribute to a better cardiovascular risk factor profile in young people.},

abstract = {We examine the links between fossil-fuel-based transportation, greenhouse-gas emissions, and health. Transport-related carbon emissions are rising and there is increasing consensus that the growth in motorised land vehicles and aviation is incompatible with averting serious climate change. The energy intensity of land transport correlates with its adverse health effects. Adverse health effects occur through climate change, road-traffic injuries, physical inactivity, urban air pollution, energy-related conflict, and environmental degradation. For the world's poor people, walking is the main mode of transport, but such populations often experience the most from the harms of energy-intensive transport. New energy sources and improvements in vehicle design and in information technology are necessary but not sufficient to reduce transport-related carbon emissions without accompanying behavioural change. By contrast, active transport has the potential to improve health and equity, and reduce emissions. Cities require safe and pleasant environments for active transport with destinations in easy reach and, for longer journeys, public transport that is powered by renewable energy, thus providing high levels of accessibility without car use. Much investment in major road projects does not meet the transport needs of poor people, especially women whose trips are primarily local and off road. Sustainable development is better promoted through improving walking and cycling infrastructures, increasing access to cycles, and investment in transport services for essential needs. Our model of London shows how increased active transport could help achieve substantial reductions in emissions by 2030 while improving population health. There exists the potential for a global contraction and convergence in use of fossil-fuel energy for transport to benefit health and achieve sustainability.},

abstract = {In The Netherlands, on bicycle paths, single-bicycle accidents, bicycle-bicycle and bicycle-moped accidents constitute a considerable share of all bicyclist injuries. Over three quarters of all hospitalised bicyclist victims in the Netherlands cannot be directly related to a crash with motorised traffic. As the usage of bicycle paths steadily increases, it is to be expected that safety on bicycle paths will become a major issue in the coming years in The Netherlands. A study was conducted into the behaviour of bicyclists and moped riders to improve traffic safety on bicycle paths. By behavioural observations with video, mutual conflicts and bicyclist behaviour on bicycle paths were recorded and analysed, among other things by means of the conflict observation method DOCTOR (Dutch Objective Conflict Technique for Operation and Research). The explorative phase of the study (phase 1), included two research locations, one in the city of Amsterdam and one in Eindhoven. The results gave guidance for a better understanding of the behaviour between different users of separate two-directional bicycle paths. An example includes the relationship between bicyclist-moped rider behaviour and the width of the bicycle path. For a condition with busy bicycle traffic in both directions the width of the bicycle path in Amsterdam (effectively 3.55m) is relatively narrow, whereas the bicycle path width in Eindhoven (>4.94m) appears to be sufficient to accommodate large flows of bicyclists. Because of a large flow of crossing pedestrians resulting in (severe) conflicts with bicyclists in Amsterdam, additional countermeasures to better control these interactions are needed. The DOCTOR conflict observation method from video appears to be applicable for conflicts between intersecting road users and for head-on conflicts on the bicycle path. Conflict situations between bicyclists in the same direction (constituting an important share of injury accidents on bicycle paths) require an additional and more general systematic observation of specific behaviour. Therefore, phase 2 of the project will focus in particular on interactions between bicycle path users in the same direction and underlying processes.},

abstract = {Walking and cycling can make a considerable contribution to sustainable transport goals, building healthier and more sustainable communities and contributing to traffic and pollution reduction. There have been many national and local initiatives to promote walking and cycling, but without a long term vision and consistent strategy it is difficult to see how a significant change may be achieved. This paper presents three alternative visions for the role of walking and cycling in urban areas for the year 2030: each vision illustrates a 'desirable' walking- and cycling-oriented transport system against a different 'exogenous social background'. These visions have been developed through a process of expert discussion and review and are intended to provide a stimulus for debate on the potential for and desirability of such alternative futures. Each is based on the UK and represents a substantial change to the current situation: in particular, each of the visions presents a view of a society where walking and cycling are considerably more important than is currently the case and where these modes cater for a much higher proportion of urban transport needs than at present. The visions show pictures of urban environments where dependence on motor vehicles has been reduced, in two of the visions to very low levels. The methodological approach for devising visions is informed by work on 'utopian thinking': a key concept underlying this approach is one of viewing the future in social constructivist terms (i.e. the future is what 'we', as a society, make it) rather than considering the future as something that can be 'scientifically' predicted by the extrapolation of current trends. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {An ordered-response model is used in this research to evaluate the factors that affect frequency of bicycle use for a person's commute to and from work. Data used were gathered during an original survey effort conducted over the Internet in 2002. Empirical results are presented, and policy implications of these results for urban planning are discussed. In addition, deterrents and facilitators of bicycle commuting as reported by respondents in the survey are descriptively analyzed. Several findings from this research contribute to the state of the knowledge in bicycle commuting. First, the availability of showers or clothing lockers at the work place does not appear to inspire bicycle commuters to commute by bicycle more frequently. Second, using a bicycle for nonwork trip purposes increases an individual's frequency of commuting by bicycle to work. Other important results indicate that nonbicycle commuters either have misconceptions about the dangers of bicycling or else they lack convenient, safe route options for bicycling to work. Practitioners can use the ordered-response model to estimate an individual bicycle commuter's frequency of commuting by bicycle. The results can also help practitioners estimate the effects on nonmotorized mode share of programs that compete for funds to provide bicycling safety education, bicycle parking, and promotion of bicycling.},

@article{Rutter2013,
abstract = {Increasing regular physical activity is a key public health goal. One strategy is to change the physical environment to encourage walking and cycling, requiring partnerships with the transport and urban planning sectors. Economic evaluation is an important factor in the decision to fund any new transport scheme, but techniques for assessing the economic value of the health benefits of cycling and walking have tended to be less sophisticated than the approaches used for assessing other benefits. This study aimed to produce a practical tool for estimating the economic impact of reduced mortality due to increased cycling. The tool was intended to be transparent, easy to use, reliable, and based on conservative assumptions and default values, which can be used in the absence of local data. It addressed the question: For a given volume of cycling within a defined population, what is the economic value of the health benefits? The authors used published estimates of relative risk of all-cause mortality among regular cyclists and applied these to levels of cycling defined by the user to produce an estimate of the number of deaths potentially averted because of regular cycling. The tool then calculates the economic value of the deaths averted using the "value of a statistical life." The outputs of the tool support decision making on cycle infrastructure or policies, or can be used as part of an integrated economic appraisal. The tool's unique contribution is that it takes a public health approach to a transport problem, addresses it in epidemiologic terms, and places the results back into the transport context. Examples of its use include its adoption by the English and Swedish departments of transport as the recommended methodologic approach for estimating the health impact of walking and cycling.},

@article{Boone-Heinonen2009,
abstract = {Background: Building on known associations between active commuting and reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, this study examines active transit to neighborhood amenities and differences between walking and cycling for transportation. Methods: Year-20 data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (3549 black and white adults aged 38-50 years in 2005-2006) were analyzed in 2008-2009. Sociodemographic correlates of transportation mode (car-only, walk-only, any cycling, other) to neighborhood amenities were examined in multivariable multinomial logistic models. Gender-stratified multivariable linear or multinomial regression models compared CVD risk factors across transit modes. Results: Active transit was most common to parks and public transit stops; walking was more common than cycling. Among those who used each amenity, active transit (walk-only and any cycling versus car-only transit) was more common in men and those with no live-in partner and less than full-time employment (significant ORs [95\% CI] ranging from 1.56 [1.08, 2.27] to 4.54 [1.70, 12.14]), and less common in those with children. Active transit to any neighborhood amenity was associated with more favorable BMI, waist circumference, and fitness (largest coefficient [95\% CI] -1.68 [-2.81, -0.55] for BMI, -3.41 [-5.71, -1.11] for waist circumference [cm], and 36.65 [17.99, 55.31] for treadmill test duration [seconds]). Only cycling was associated with lower lifetime CVD risk classification. Conclusions: Active transit to neighborhood amenities was related to sociodemographics and CVD risk factors. Variation in health-related benefits by active transit mode, if validated in prospective studies, may have implications for transportation planning and research. © 2009 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study compared older men and women with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in terms of the effects of a 6-month exercise intervention on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, blood pressure (BP) and other risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty older (age 61-79) overweight men and 71 such women with 2 or more risk factors (ie, systolic BP 130-179 mmHg, non-fasting blood glucose 110-139 mg/dl, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 120-219 mg/dl) participated in a 6-month exercise intervention. The exercise program consisted of moderate-intensity bicycle exercise for approximately 40 min, performed on average 2.5 times per week. Systolic and diastolic BP reductions were found to be greater in women than in men (SBP, -10.6 vs. -5.5 mmHg; DBP, -6.2 vs. -3.3 mmHg; both P<0.05). Decreases in body mass index were larger in women than in men (P<0.05). There was no significant gender difference in the changes in blood glucose and lipid profiles and hsCRP levels. After adjustment for confounders (exercise frequency, weight loss, age, and baseline values), there were still significant gender differences in the SBP and DBP reductions. hsCRP reduction were similar in both genders even after adjusting for weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: There could be gender differences in the beneficial effects of exercise training on the potent CV risk factors of BP and body weight, but not on hsCRP.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Achieving health benefits while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport offers a potential policy win-win; the magnitude of potential benefits, however, is likely to vary. This study uses an Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling tool (ITHIM) to evaluate the health and environmental impacts of high walking and cycling transport scenarios for English and Welsh urban areas outside London.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Three scenarios with increased walking and cycling and lower car use were generated based upon the Visions 2030 Walking and Cycling project. Changes to carbon dioxide emissions were estimated by environmental modelling. Health impact assessment modelling was used to estimate changes in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) resulting from changes in exposure to air pollution, road traffic injury risk, and physical activity. We compare the findings of the model with results generated using the World Health Organization's Health Economic Assessment of Transport (HEAT) tools.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: This study found considerable reductions in disease burden under all three scenarios, with the largest health benefits attributed to reductions in ischemic heart disease. The pathways that produced the largest benefits were, in order, physical activity, road traffic injuries, and air pollution. The choice of dose response relationship for physical activity had a large impact on the size of the benefits. Modelling the impact on all-cause mortality rather than through individual diseases suggested larger benefits. Using the best available evidence we found fewer road traffic injuries for all scenarios compared with baseline but alternative assumptions suggested potential increases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Methods to estimate the health impacts from transport related physical activity and injury risk are in their infancy; this study has demonstrated an integration of transport and health impact modelling approaches. The findings add to the case for a move from car transport to walking and cycling, and have implications for empirical and modelling research.},

abstract = {This tutorial is an introduction to spatial data in R and map making with R's `base' graphics and the popular graphics package ggplot2. It assumes no prior knowledge of spatial data analysis but prior understanding of the R command line would be beneficial. For people new to R, we recommend working through an `Introduction to R' type tutorial, such as "A (very) short introduction to R" (Torfs and Brauer, 2012) or the more geographically inclined "Short introduction to R" (Harris, 2012). Building on such background material, the following set of exercises is concerned with specific functions for spatial data and visualisation. It is divided into five parts: *Introduction, which provides a guide to R's syntax and preparing for the tutorial *Spatial data in R, which describes basic spatial functions in R *Manipulating spatial data, which includes changing projection, clipping and spatial joins *Map making with ggplot2, a recent graphics package for producing beautiful maps quickly *Taking spatial analysis in R further, a compilation of resources for furthering your skills An up-to-date version of this tutorial is maintained at https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R and the entire tutorial, including the input data can be downloaded as a zip file, as described below. The entire tutorialwas written in RMarkdown, which allows R code to run as the document compiles. Thus all the examples are entirely reproducible. Suggested improvements welcome - please fork, improve and push this document to its original home to ensure its longevity.

The results show that there is no significant improvement in model goodness of fit until a deterrence-function characterisation is used which is based on a family of functions, with the spatial domain of each function being determined in an approximately optimal manner. These findings are consistent with theoretical research on microlevel trip behaviour and can be used to identify descriptive models which possess maximum levels of performance},

abstract = {To investigate the prevalence of active transport (AT, defined as walking or bicycling for transport) and to explore the association between AT and health outcomes, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study in Jiangsu, China, where walking and bicycling are still the main modes of transport. In this study, 8400 community residents aged 18 or above were interviewed following a multistage random sampling method (100\% response rate). Face-to-face questionnaire survey data, anthropometric measurements, and biochemical data from blood tests were collected. Results show that 49.6\% of the subjects, as part of daily transport, actively traveled on average 5.3 days per week, 53.5 minutes per day, and 300.3 minutes per week. There was an inverse correlation between AT and some health outcomes: AT respondents had a higher prevalence of cholesterol disorder; AT respondents who actively travelled every day had a higher risk of diabetes, whilst AT respondents with shorter daily or weekly duration had a lower risk of obesity, central obesity, and cholesterol disorder. Moreover, AT influences more health aspects among urban residents than among rural residents. Findings of this study do not support the notion that AT is beneficial to population health. Further research is needed in determining the negative side effects of AT.},

@article{Jacobsen2003a,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between the numbers of people walking or bicycling and the frequency of collisions between motorists and walkers or bicyclists. The common wisdom holds that the number of collisions varies directly with the amount of walking and bicycling. However, three published analyses of collision rates at specific intersections found a non-linear relationship, such that collisions rates declined with increases in the numbers of people walking or bicycling.

DATA: This paper uses five additional data sets (three population level and two time series) to compare the amount of walking or bicycling and the injuries incurring in collisions with motor vehicles.

RESULTS: The likelihood that a given person walking or bicycling will be struck by a motorist varies inversely with the amount of walking or bicycling. This pattern is consistent across communities of varying size, from specific intersections to cities and countries, and across time periods.

DISCUSSION: This result is unexpected. Since it is unlikely that the people walking and bicycling become more cautious if their numbers are larger, it indicates that the behavior of motorists controls the likelihood of collisions with people walking and bicycling. It appears that motorists adjust their behavior in the presence of people walking and bicycling. There is an urgent need for further exploration of the human factors controlling motorist behavior in the presence of people walking and bicycling.

CONCLUSION: A motorist is less likely to collide with a person walking and bicycling if more people walk or bicycle. Policies that increase the numbers of people walking and bicycling appear to be an effective route to improving the safety of people walking and bicycling.},

@article{Laakso2011,
abstract = {Open Access (OA) is a model for publishing scholarly peer reviewed journals, made possible by the Internet. The full text of OA journals and articles can be freely read, as the publishing is funded through means other than subscriptions. Empirical research concerning the quantitative development of OA publishing has so far consisted of scattered individual studies providing brief snapshots, using varying methods and data sources. This study adopts a systematic method for studying the development of OA journals from their beginnings in the early 1990s until 2009. Because no comprehensive index of OA articles exists, systematic manual data collection from journal web sites was conducted based on journal-level data extracted from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Due to the high number of journals registered in the DOAJ, almost 5000 at the time of the study, stratified random sampling was used. A separate sample of verified early pioneer OA journals was also studied. The results show a very rapid growth of OA publishing during the period 1993-2009. During the last year an estimated 191 000 articles were published in 4769 journals. Since the year 2000, the average annual growth rate has been 18\% for the number of journals and 30\% for the number of articles. This can be contrasted to the reported 3,5\% yearly volume increase in journal publishing in general. In 2009 the share of articles in OA journals, of all peer reviewed journal articles, reached 7,7\%. Overall, the results document a rapid growth in OA journal publishing over the last fifteen years. Based on the sampling results and qualitative data a division into three distinct periods is suggested: The Pioneering years (1993-1999), the Innovation years (2000-2004), and the Consolidation years (2005-2009).},

abstract = {Increased walking and cycling in urban areas and reduced use of private cars could have positive effects on many health outcomes. We estimated the potential effect of increased walking and cycling in urban England and Wales on costs to the National Health Service (NHS) for seven diseases--namely, type 2 diabetes, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, depression, and ischaemic heart disease--that are associated with physical inactivity. Within 20 years, reductions in the prevalences of type 2 diabetes, dementia, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer because of increased physical activity would lead to savings of roughly UK£17 billion (in 2010 prices) for the NHS, after adjustment for an increased risk of road traffic injuries. Further costs would be averted after 20 years. Sensitivity analyses show that results are invariably positive but sensitive to assumptions about time lag between the increase in active travel and changes in health outcomes. Increasing the amount of walking and cycling in urban settings could reduce costs to the NHS, permitting decreased government expenditure on health or releasing resources to fund additional health care.},

Bicycling for transportation is a modality of physical activity that people can incorporate easily into their daily lives. A qualitative study using 11 semi-structured individual interviews and 5 focus groups was conducted among 31 male and 13 female adult residents of Bogot찼, Colombia in 2006. The study explored barriers and facilitators of bicycle use for transportation purposes. People were selected based on socioeconomic status, age, and gender. Thematic analysis complemented with thematic network analysis was used to analyze the data. Six main themes emerged from the study: (1) general acknowledgment of individual and collective benefits of bicycle use; (2) built environment conditions were linked with bicycle use; (3) some social factors affect bicycling negatively; (4) people perceived conflicts over public space related to the use of bike-paths;( 5) general negative public perception of bicyclists; and (6) gender differences influence patterns of bicycle use. The findings from this qualitative study show that various social and physical barriers must be addressed to increase bicycle use as a means of transportation in Bogot찼.},

abstract = {In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller,Limits to Growththe first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001. Meadows newly released manuscript,Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institutes Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the worldwar, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradationare essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent,Thinking in Systemshelps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.},

abstract = {This study aimed to estimate the association of cyclists' age and sex with the risk of being involved in a crash with and without adjustment for their amount of exposure. We used the distribution of the entire population and cyclists (total and non-responsible) involved in road crashes in Spain between 1993 and 2009 held by the Spanish National Institute of Statistics and the Spanish General Traffic Directorate to calculate rates of exposure and involvement in a crash. Males aged 45-49 years were used as the reference category to obtain exposure rate ratios (ERR) and unadjusted crash rate ratios (URR). We then used these values in decomposition analysis to calculate crash rate ratios adjusted for exposure (ARR). The pattern of ARR was substantially different from URR. In both sexes the highest values were observed in the youngest age groups, and the values decreased as age increased except for a slight increase in the oldest age groups. In males, a slight increase in the lowest and highest age categories was observed for crashes resulting in severe injury or death, and a decrease was observed for the youngest cyclists who were wearing a helmet. The large differences between age and sex groups in the risk of involvement in a cycling crash are strongly dependent on differences in their exposure rates. Taking exposure rates into account, cyclists younger than 30 years and older than 65 years of age had the highest risk of being involved in a crash.},

abstract = {<p>We conduct a detailed investigation of correlations between real-time expressions of individuals made across the United States and a wide range of emotional, geographic, demographic, and health characteristics. We do so by combining (1) a massive, geo-tagged data set comprising over 80 million words generated in 2011 on the social network service Twitter and (2) annually-surveyed characteristics of all 50 states and close to 400 urban populations. Among many results, we generate taxonomies of states and cities based on their similarities in word use; estimate the happiness levels of states and cities; correlate highly-resolved demographic characteristics with happiness levels; and connect word choice and message length with urban characteristics such as education levels and obesity rates. Our results show how social media may potentially be used to estimate real-time levels and changes in population-scale measures such as obesity rates.</p>},

Although progress is being made in a number of areas, vehicle occupant fatalities have not been falling in line with casualty reduction targets for the year 2010. A sample of 1185 fatal vehicle occupant cases was considered, from ten UK police forces, from the years 1994-2005 inclusive. The main findings were: (1) over 65\% of the accidents examined involved driving at excessive speed, a driver in excess of the legal alcohol limit, or the failure to wear a seat belt by a fatality, or some combination of these. (2) Young drivers have the great majority of their accidents by losing control on bends or curves, typically at night in rural areas and/or while driving for 'leisure' purposes. These accidents show high levels of speeding, alcohol involvement and recklessness. (3) Older drivers had fewer accidents, but those fatalities they were involved in tended to involve misjudgement and perceptual errors in 'right of way' collisions, typically in the daytime on rural rather than urban roads. Blameworthy right of way errors were notably high for drivers aged over 65 years, as a proportion of total fatal accidents in that age group.},

abstract = {To curtail the rising numbers of cyclists seriously injured in road crashes, more insights are needed into the factors that contribute to these crashes. For instance, darkness is known to be associated with higher injury rates, but little is known about the relative influence of factors such as poor conspicuity, impaired perception and alcohol use among cyclists. To examine these factors, the present study analyzed the epidemiological crash data for three meteorological light conditions: daylight, late evening darkness and early morning darkness; for two crash types: crashes with (M-crashes) and without motorized traffic (NM-crashes); and for different age groups. The relative injury rates (injury risk per distance travelled in darkness corrected for daylight injury risks for each age group) confirmed findings from earlier studies that cycling in late evening darkness is associated with higher injury rates than cycling in daylight conditions. This is the case for both crash types with only small differences between the age groups suggesting that poor conspicuity (M-crashes) and impaired perception (NM-crashes) may play a role. In comparison to late evening darkness, relative injury rates in early morning darkness are much higher. This is the case for both crash types with large differences among the age groups, suggesting that in addition to the absence of daylight also age related risk factors are at play. Support for this hypothesis was found from the analyses of hospital records, showing that the proportion of seriously injured cyclists who have been drinking is highest in early morning darkness and has strongly increased over the last decades. These insights provide input for the selection of countermeasures such as improved lighting (both street and bicycle lights) and interventions targeting alcohol use among cyclists.},

One technique uses hill-climbing algorithms, and the other is based on iterated proportional fitting. In this article, we identify the general characteristics of both techniques. We present and evaluate an example (generating cross-tabulations of households by housing value and number of children enrolled in public school), briefly discuss extensions of both techniques to synthetic population construction, and test the synthetic populations by comparing the estimated microsamples with the actual population.},

abstract = {The effect of short-term aerobic exercise on vascular function of young individuals with a family history of hypertension was investigated. Thirty young men with a family history of hypertension were randomly assigned to either an exercise (n=15) or control (n=15) group. Exercise subjects performed 30 min of supervised cycle training at 65\% of their maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), three times per week for 4 weeks. Control subjects were asked to maintain their normal levels of physical activity. Peak leg and forearm blood flow were assessed using plethysmography and was determined as the highest blood flow following 5 min of reactive hyperemia. Cardiopulmonary baroreceptor (CPBR) sensitivity was measured using lower body negative pressure (LBNP) for 5 min at -20 mm Hg. CPBR was determined by calculating change of stroke volume and forearm vascular resistance at baseline and during LBNP. Carotid baroreceptor (CBR) sensitivity was assessed using neck suction at -20, -40, -60 and -80 mm Hg pressures, and was determined from RR interval divided by systolic blood pressure. Augmentation index (AIx), a measure of arterial stiffness, was assessed using applanation tonometry and was calculated as the ratio of augmented pressure and pulse pressure. The major findings were that the exercise group showed increase in leg vasodilation, reduction in AIx and increase in VO(2max) compared with the control group (P<0.05). However, there was no significant change for CPBR and CBR. A short-term moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention in young men with a family history of hypertension significantly reduced arterial stiffness and increased aerobic fitness.},

abstract = {A high and sustainable quality of life is a central goal for humanity.
Our current socio-ecological regime and its set of interconnected
worldviews, institutions, and technologies all support the goal of
unlimited growth of material production and consumption as a proxy
for quality of life. However, abundant evidence shows that, beyond
a certain threshold, further material growth no longer significantly
contributes to improvement in quality of life. Not only does further
material growth not meet humanity's central goal, there is mounting
evidence that it creates significant roadblocks to sustainability
through increasing resource constraints (i.e., peak oil, water limitations)
and sink constraints (i.e., climate disruption). Overcoming these
roadblocks and creating a sustainable and desirable future will require
an integrated, systems level redesign of our socio-ecological regime
focused explicitly and directly on the goal of sustainable quality
of life rather than the proxy of unlimited material growth. This
transition, like all cultural transitions, will occur through an
evolutionary process, but one that we, to a certain extent, can control
and direct. We suggest an integrated set of worldviews, institutions,
and technologies to stimulate and seed this evolutionary redesign
of the current socio-ecological regime to achieve global sustainability.},

@article{berry_free_2006,
abstract = {This article considers the implications that the use of free and open-source software in government might have for democracy and public participation. From a constructionist perspective, the democratic 'effects' of non-proprietary software are contingent on how the practice of free and open-source software is discursively represented and constituted as it is translated into new e-government systems. On these premises, an analysis of official discourse and government policy for non-proprietary software suggests that its introduction into government will bring more 'politics as usual' rather than democratisation. Nevertheless, on the basis of an alternative discourse of ethics and freedom evident in the Free Software and Open Source communities, the authors of this paper envisage circumstances in which the discourse and practice of non-proprietary software contribute to opening-up and democratising e-government, by protecting and extending transparency and accountability in e-governments and by offering scope for technology to be shaped by citizens and associations as well as by administrators and private interests.},

Policies that encourage active modes of transportation such as cycling may, for example, increase population physical activity and decrease air pollution, thus reducing the burden of conditions such as some cancers, diabetes, heart disease and dementia. In this Perspective we systematically review the evidence from 'real life' transport policies and their impacts on health and \{CO2\} emissions. We identified a few studies that mostly involved personalized travel planning and showed modest increases in active transport such as walking, and reductions in vehicle use and \{CO2\} emissions. Given the poor quality of the studies identified, urgent action is needed to provide more robust evidence for policies.},
