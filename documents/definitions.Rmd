## Concepts and measures on level of cycling

- **Current level of cycling** (*CLC*) refers to the amount of current cycling activity.
  It can be measured as a proportion (or prevalence) in terms of the number of
  regular cyclists (*NC*) --- e.g. the number who regularly
  cycle to work (*NC~commute~*) or the number who would classify themselves as
  leisure cyclists (*NC~leisure~*). Alternatively it can be measured as a rate,
  as the number of trips per year
  or week (*NT~yr~* or *NT~wk~*).
  
- **Potential level of cycling** (*PLC*)
  is the *expected* rate of cycling in given area or between
  origin-destination pairs, under a certain set of assumptions, including
  a given background cycling modal share.
  This potential level is calculated using a model which
  incorporates the impact of distance (see *distance decay*, below),
  socio-demographics (and its influence on distance decay)
  the transport network (e.g. *circuity* and the presence of dedicated cycle paths)
  and other place-specific variables such as hilliness. *PLC* can be projected
  into the future based on assumptions about the overall rate of cycling, likelihood
  to shift to cycling and changes in distance decay by socio-demographic group.
  
- **Extra cycling potential** (*ECP*) is the number of additional trips or cyclists
  that can be expected in a given scenario of the future. Formally, this can be 
  defined as the *potential level of cycling* (under a set of assumptions) minus
  the current rate of cycling. For the number of people who regularly cycle to work,
  for example, *ECP* would be defined as follows:
  
$$
ECP_{commute} = PC_{commute} - NC_{commute}
$$

- Note that *ECP* can also be defined as a fraction, showing the percentage increase
  in cycling following a particular policy intervention. We can call this 
  **proportional increase in cycling** (*PIC*):
  
$$
PIC = \frac{PC}{NC}
$$

## Other definitions
  
- **Distance decay** (*DD*) is function that relates the distance (*d*) of a trip to
  the probability (or odds) of it being made by a specific mode of travel (e.g. by bicycle) with
  respect to predefined set of explanatory variables (*X*)
  such as the person's socio-demographic group and the hilliness of the local area.
  
$$
DD = f(d, X)
$$

- **Circuity** (*Q*) is the actual length of a trip along the transport network compared
    with the straight-line (*Euclidean*) distance. Formally,
    
$$
Q = \frac{d_{R}}{d_{E}}
$$
